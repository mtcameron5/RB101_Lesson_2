# Pseudo-code
  # Understand the Problem
    # while user wants to keep going
      # - ask the user for a collection of numbers
      # - iterate through the collection one by one.
        # - save the first value as the starting value.
        # - for each iteration, compare the saved value with the current value.
        # - if the saved value is greater, or it's the same,
        #   move to the next value in the collection
        # - otherwise, if the current value is greater
        #   reassign the saved value as the current value
      # - after iterating through the collection, save the largest value into the list.
      # - ask the user if they want to input another collection
    # return saved list of numbers
